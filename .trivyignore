# Use this file to mark vulnerabilities to ignore. Please ensure there is a comment justifying each entry

# This is fixed in 1.20.10, 1.21.3, but we cannot move to these without breaking
# FIPS compliance. There is an ongoing effort to enable upgrading go:
# CONJSE-1865. This ticket is the follow-up to remove this ignore: CONJSE-1870.
#
# 1) CVE-2023-39325: Conjur does not use http2
# 2) CVE-2023-45283: File paths used by filepath package are defaulted to
#                    $HOME/.conjurrc, $HOME/conjur-server.pem, and can be
#                    overridden by the user. These contain details used to
#                    verify and authenticate to the Conjur server, but are not
#                    enough alone to authenticate to Conjur as a given user.
#                    A correctly configured OS and file system should prevent
#                    end-users from exploiting this vulnerability to reference
#                    another users' files. If they did, they would still need to
#                    authenticate with Conjur with the correct credentials using
#                    whichever authenticator.
# 3) CVE-2023-45287: The tls package is only used to verify the certificate of
#                    the Conjur server against the certificate saved during
#                    the `conjur init` process. No secrets are transmitted
#                    during any sessions with this package.
# 4) CVE-2023-45288: Conjur does not use http2
